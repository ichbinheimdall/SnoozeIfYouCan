# 📋 Project Status

## Current State: ARCHIVED ⚠️

**Last Updated**: January 28, 2026  
**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Status**: Archived pending AlarmKit improvements

## Why Archived?

Apple's **AlarmKit** framework, announced at WWDC 2024, is not yet production-ready for third-party alarm apps. While the framework exists in iOS 18+, it has significant limitations that prevent reliable alarm delivery:

- ❌ Not available in iOS Simulator
- ❌ Entitlement access unclear/restricted
- ❌ Incomplete API implementation
- ❌ Cannot replicate native Clock app behavior
- ❌ Unreliable system integration

## What Works ✅

Despite the archival status, significant progress has been made:

### Completed Features

- ✅ **Core Alarm Functionality**: Create, edit, delete, toggle alarms
- ✅ **Escalating Snooze Costs**: $0.99 → $9.99 over 5 snoozes
- ✅ **Maximum Snooze Enforcement**: Hard limit of 5 snoozes
- ✅ **Full-Screen Alarm UI**: Beautiful, accessible alarm interface
- ✅ **Donation Tracking**: Statistics dashboard for impact
- ✅ **Payment Integration**: StoreKit 2 for in-app purchases
- ✅ **iCloud Sync**: CloudKit integration for cross-device sync
- ✅ **Localization**: English and Turkish support
- ✅ **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and high contrast mode
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode implementation
- ✅ **Onboarding**: First-run experience with permission requests
- ✅ **Settings**: Complete settings screen with preferences
- ✅ **Apple Watch**: Basic watch app support
- ✅ **Widget**: Home screen widget with alarm info
- ✅ **Achievements**: Badge system for milestones
- ✅ **Social Features**: Share progress, accountability partners
- ✅ **Focus Mode**: Integration with iOS Focus filters

### Code Quality

- ✅ **SwiftUI Architecture**: Modern MVVM pattern
- ✅ **Swift 6.0**: Latest language features and concurrency
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Inline docs, README, guides
- ✅ **Open Source Ready**: LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- ✅ **Well-Organized**: Clear folder structure and separation of concerns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and user feedback
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout codebase

## What Doesn't Work ❌

### Critical Limitations

1. **AlarmKit Reliability**
   - Framework authorization inconsistent
   - Simulator testing impossible
   - Entitlements not publicly available
   - System integration incomplete

2. **Fallback Approach Issues**
   - UserNotifications can be dismissed by user
   - System can delay/drop notifications
   - Background execution not guaranteed
   - No deep sleep wake capability

3. **Trust Factor**
   - Users won't trust third-party apps for critical wake-ups
   - Native Clock app has special system privileges
   - Cannot guarantee alarm fires when needed

### Non-Critical Issues

- ⚠️ No server-side payment verification (client-side only)
- ⚠️ Data export to clipboard only (should use share sheet)
- ⚠️ CloudKit sync not thoroughly tested
- ⚠️ Watch app basic functionality only
- ⚠️ Widget updates not real-time

## What's Needed to Un-Archive

### From Apple

1. **AlarmKit Improvements**
   - Public entitlement access
   - Simulator support
   - Complete API implementation
   - Documentation and examples
   - Reliability guarantees

2. **Timeline**: Unknown
   - Monitor WWDC announcements
   - Watch iOS beta releases
   - Track developer community feedback

### From This Project

1. **Testing Suite**
   - Unit tests for managers
   - UI tests for critical flows
   - Integration tests for AlarmKit

2. **Production Features**
   - Server-side payment verification
   - Real charity integration
   - Advanced data export
   - More comprehensive CloudKit sync

3. **App Store Prep**
   - Privacy Policy published
   - Terms of Service created
   - App Store Connect configured
   - Marketing materials prepared

## Can I Use This Code?

**Yes!** This project is open source (MIT License). You can:

✅ Fork and modify for learning  
✅ Use as reference for your projects  
✅ Build upon the architecture  
✅ Extract components for reuse  
✅ Study the AlarmKit integration approach  

**But remember**: Don't ship an alarm app to production without solving the AlarmKit reliability issues. Your users will be disappointed when alarms don't fire.

### Q: Will you accept PRs?
**A**: Yes! Code quality improvements and new features are welcome.

### Q: Can I ship a modified version to the App Store?
**A**: Yes, but you'll face the same AlarmKit limitations. Be honest with users about reliability.

### Q: What if I have AlarmKit entitlement access?
**A**: Great! Open an issue and let's collaborate. Your insights would be valuable.

### Q: Is there a Discord/Slack?
**A**: Not currently. Use GitHub Discussions for now.
